# From Failure Modes to Strategy: A Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) Blueprint

This project simulates a real-world Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) implementation — from functional analysis and failure modes to task selection and strategy deployment. It applies the logic of SAE JA1011/1012 standards to create a systematic, cost-effective, and risk-aware maintenance plan.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🛠 Define system functions and performance standards
- 🔍 Identify failure modes using FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)
- 🧠 Evaluate failure consequences (safety, operational, non-operational)
- 🧮 Apply RCM decision logic to select optimal maintenance tasks
- 📑 Develop an actionable, prioritized maintenance strategy
